How it works ? ü§î ::
First, extract the FoxBruteBTC .exe software from the .rar file onto your computer desktop. 
Then, open the software FoxBruteBTC .exe. 
We're not going to talk too much, we're going to directly explain the use of our .dat wallet brute force software.
The software interface is very simple.
A warning message will appear - click 'Yes' to accept the disclaimer.
Click on the written button (Select File) you need to import only the .dat file format of Bitcoin Core.
Then click on the button below (Save in..) to save the private key in the selected directory it will be decrypted in a .txt file
Once you have imported the .dat file and selected the save file, you need to click on the button just below (Force Wallet).
A dialog box will open showing you the step-by-step decryption.
Please note that any other file from another wallet will not accept and a message will appear in the dialog box (Error wallet).
The private key decryption process may take more than 3 hours to 4 hours.
Once the decryption is successful the dialog box will show you the private key of the wallet if you are afraid of closing the dialog box or the software by mistake do not worry it will be saved in the directory you have selected everything will be there inside the .txt file.

If I close the software or the dialog box by mistake, what happens? 
If you close the software and the decryption dialog box is in progress, you will have to start the process again...
Can I export multiple wallets? 
No, just 1 .dat wallet...
Can I open the software twice to decrypt at the same time? 
Yes, you can.
However, please note that this may cause your computer to heat up and the RAM may quickly become saturated...
Do you share data? 
No, data and private keys do not leave your computer. 
You alone own it and no data is transmitted...
